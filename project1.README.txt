be sure to include complete details of how to interact with your game, the scoring system, and how to win

Watch the Fox play with the Box.

Interaction:
Use the A S W & D keys to move Left Down Up Right in order to get the Squares, or objectives
If you press 1 after touching the bottom (dying) you restart (Saves highscore, resets points, resets positioning)

Scoring System:
For every objective you acquire you recieve a point, and a gravity bonus.
As gravity increases it becomes harder for the character --> YOU <-- to move.
That red stuff is looking kind of....warm?

Win or Lose?
If you touch the Bottom of the Map, or the red area (Almost reminds you of lava right?) then you lose.
If you make it to 20 points you win, but can continue in order to painstakingly crawl ahead of the high score.
